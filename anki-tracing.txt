# This is a set of Anki cards. Example:
# What is meant by "resident memory"?
# What do you call memory that currently resides in main memory?
# 
# What is the synonym for physical memory?
# What is the synonym for main memory?
# 
# What kind of memory is the heap (in terms of paging)?
# Anonymous memory.
# 
# Historically, how big have memory pages been? (2 values)
# 4 or 8 KB.
# 
# How can virtual memory be bigger than main memory?
# Swapping.
# 
# What are the two kinds of paging?
# * file system paging
# * swapping
# 
# What is a synonym for swapping?
# What is a synonym for anonymous paging?
# 
# Why is anonymous paging called anonymous?
# Because it doesn't refer to data with any defined file system location.
# 
# In terms of memory, what does RSS stand for?
# Resident Set Size.
# 
# What is the difference between allocated and mapped memory?
# Allocated memory has been reserved in virtual memory, but not necessarily mapped to a location in physical memory.
# 
# What does resident set size measure?
# The amount of memory that has been allocated and mapped to physical memory.
# 
# What does virtual memory size measure?
# The amount of memory that has been allocated in virtual memory, whether or not it has been mapped.
# 
# Besides being mapped to physical memory, what else might a virtual address be mapped to?
# Swap.
# 
# What was the maximum process size on the PDP-11?
# 64 KB.
# 
# What are the states that a page of virtual memory can be in? (4)
# * {{c1::unallocated}}
# * {{c2::allocated, but unmappped}}
# * {{c3::allocated and mapped to main memory}}
# * {{c4::allocated and mapped to swap}}
# 
# What stdlib function is used to allocate memory?
# malloc.
# 
# In terms of memory, what does PSS stand for?
# Proportional Set Size.
# 
# What does proportional set size measure?
# The private memory usage of a process, excluding shared memory.
# 
# Which tool can I use to measure proportional set size?
# pmap.
# 
# What's the maximum amount of memory a 32bit process can address?
# 4 GB.
# 
# On Linux, how much virtual memory is reserved for the kernel?
# 1 GB.
# 
# What does DRAM stand for?
# Dynamic Random Access Memory.
# 
# What two electrical components are used for each bit in DRAM?
# A capacitor and a transistor.
# 
# Why does DRAM lose values when power is removed?
# Because a capacitor loses charge without power.
# 
# What do we use to measure the access time of main memory?
# The time between sending a memory module the desired address and when the data is available to be read.
# 
# What is the weird term used to refer to main memory access time?
# Column address strobe.
# 
# Per Gregg, what is the access latency for DDR4?
# 10-20 ns.

# Briefly, what is a kfunc?
# It's like a next-generation kprobe.

# What bpftrace event can I subscribe to so I can do something every 1 second?
# interval:s:1
